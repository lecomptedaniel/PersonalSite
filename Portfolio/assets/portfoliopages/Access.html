							<h2>Problem Space</h2>
							<p>As ironic as it is, scheduling and managing rides on Access transportation is practically and pragmatically inaccessible to those who use it.
								One of our teammates, Kiera, happened to suggest this problem space as she, at the time, worked intimately with persons who relied on Access,
								and noticed the strong comments and opinions they had on Access's lack of accessiblity. 
							</p>
							<p>Of particular interest of the various problems or opportunities that are within the end-to-end Access service, we narrowed in on the 
								scheduling section as one that was narrow enough to be investigated within 10 weeks and to have a possible solution that could be implemented.
								The issues of the process within riding the buses, or of scheduling routes and buses, seemed to be a bit beyond our scope.
							</p>
							<p>From here, we took the issues that were initally reported as our starting points into research and further investigation:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Rigid scheduling system does not respond well to user needs</li>
								<li>Lack of flexibility in scheduling does not allow users to integrate this critical service smoothly into their lives</li>
								<li>Those that scheduled frequently, up to 4 times a week, for others under their care (such as care-takers) had different experiences and needs compared
									to those that scheduled for themselves (such as those who had a disability but we largely independent or did not live in an assisted living-home)
								</li>
							</ul>
						
							<span class="image main"><img src="../../images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>Research was broken up into three sections and methods: a broad survey, in-depth interviews, and a short literature review. These methods
								were chosen as a mixed-method approach to cover surface level details across many target users as well as deep information that is steeped in 
								context across a few users.
							</p>
							<h4>In-depth interviews</h4>
							<p>With Kiera's job, we had access to many willing target users who had a wealth of experience in scheduling these Access rides. In particular, 
								we aimed to focus in on those who we're frequent schedulers for others, as here was an opportunity to possibly impact a larger portion
								of the actions to schedule rides among Access users.
							</p>
							<p>We conducted five semi-structured interviews, asking about a range of topics, all pertaining to their current process and experience in 
								scheduling rides with Access. To ground the interviews in further context, we encouraged all participants to bring artifacts of their 
								experience, such as scheduling tables or planners, that could prompt communication about their habits, behaviors, and emotions or values in 
								this process of scheduling.
							</p>
							<p>Results:</p>

							<h4>Survey</h4>
							<p>With our survey, we aimed at understanding a bit more about our target users that scheduled Access rides for themselves. They have 
								unique experiences in both being scheduler and rider, and that they may have troubles utilizing certain technologies or tools given 
								some disabilities that may be present. 
							</p>
							<p>We received 22 total responses, 
							</p>
							<p>Results:</p>

							<h4>Literature review</h4>
							<p>To better understand what has been understood and done before collectively in this problem space, we conducted a short literature review to 
								better understand how we might address this problem space in our research and in our eventual designs.
							</p>
							<p>BLAh blah blah
							</p>
							<p>Results:</p>

							<h4>Interview and conversation with MARK MARKISON</h4>
							<p>With Kiera's job, we had access to many willing target users who had a wealth of experience in scheduling these Access rides. In particular, 
								we aimed to focus in on those who we're frequent schedulers for others, as here was an opportunity to possibly impact a larger portion
								of the actions to schedule rides among Access users.

							<h2>What was done (DESIGN)</h2>
							<p>This is where the problem space is described in a bit more detail. How did we take insights and use it in the design</p>
							<p>How does this design address the problem space? How does it show an improvement of the original state into the preferred one?</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="../../images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>End Result</h2>
							<p>What happened as a result of this work? Why does it matter in the grand scheme of things?</p>
