							<h3>Summary</h3>
							<p>
								As a team of MHCI students, we are working to deeply understand, through research, how we might assist activist organizations 
								better engage their users for more meaningful and long-term work. We designed a tool, BetterWorld, to combine the powerful 
								effects of visualizing the nebulous work that is activism with a flexible, yet structured format for task and project management 
								and visibility into institutional and group knowledge.</p>
							<p>
								Through a series of focus groups and a range of interviews with Subject Matter Experts, End-Users, as well as leaders of organizations,
								We utilized a focus group approach to understand the general problem space and refine our research questions. Then we conducted an initial round of generative research 
								to learn more about X, Y, and Z, through a Literature Review and qualitative interviews with two groups of users: End-Users who are users of these activist organizations, 
								and stakeholders who are the leaders and organizers of these organizations.
							</p>
							<p>
								From here, we had a sufficent depth of understanding to begin thinking about how we might address our research questions and craft a design that would benefit the end-users.
								Through a series of brainstorming processes, rounds of feedback and critique, as well as iterative testing and re-design, we created BetterWorld.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some users of the team are taking this project and work so far and expanding on it through a case-study approach to creating an MVP and disseminating further research.
							</p>

							<h2>Problem Space And Context</h2>
							<p>
								This project was situated within the a semester long course, where we were challenged with a student-defined project to apply persuasive techniques learned in Geoff Kaufman’s 
								<a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/courses/special-topics-persuasive-design-hci" target="_blank">Persuasive Design class</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, within the <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a>. 
								Our team focused on civic engagement with the goal of maintaining and increasing engagement among members of activist organizations. I found this topic area to be highly intriguing and right in the center of my interests to use my skills 
								for projects, designs, and solutions that benefit others in the long-run. To understand and support activist work, we work towards addressing inequities systematically.
							</p>
							<blockquote>"How might we strengthen and increase engagement of actively participating members in social activist groups by encouraging them to stay involved longer in ways that work for them?"</blockquote>
							<p>
								Activism happens on a long-term scale, with work taking months or years to achieve desired results, and progress is often difficult to measure. In order to more effectively work towards their shared mission, 
								activists need tools that encourage sustainable, long-term engagement. They need a solution that helps effort compound over time rather than die off, as well as more visibility into institutional and group knowledge.
							</p>
						
							<hr>
							<h2>Process</h2>

							<p>
								We utilized a broad set of methods to initially ground us in the problem space, formulate our above problem statement, and hone in on an actionable set of user needs:
								
							</p>
							<div class="row gtr-uniform col-12">
								<div class="col-6">
									<p><span class="material-icons image left">emoji_objects</span>
										Generative research using the <a href="http://newmetaphors.com/">"New Metaphors"</a> activity in focus groups to better understand the broader context of volunteering and social justice activism</p>
									<p><span class="material-icons image left">emoji_people</span>
										Through a series of in-depth interviews with members of activist organizations as well as leaders of these orgs, hone in on an actionable problem that would 
										substaintially benefit the organization and their long-term efforts</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-6">
									<p><span class="material-icons image left">view_comfy</span>
										Rapidly sketch many potential solutions and systematically evaluate each to hone in a few, solid ideas that address the problem at hand</p>
									<p><span class="material-icons image left">help</span>
										Test a few ideas by putting them in front of our target users (members and leaders), gather feedback from a diverse group of stakeholders, and pick
										the most promising and effective solution</p>
								</div>
								<p><span class="material-icons image left">directions_run</span>
									Iteratively improve on this one solution through multiple rounds of testing, feedback, and increasing fidelity while honing in on a key set of features
									that directly benefit the users</p>

							<h2>Initial set of Research</h2>
							<a href="http://newmetaphors.com/"><span class="image left"><img src="../portfoliopages/portfolioAssets/BetterWorldAssets/Metaphors.png"></span></a>
							<h3>Generative research through the New Metaphors activity Focus Groups</h3>
								<p>The New Metaphors activity is a fantastic way to collect
									generative research and insights about our research area, covering a large amount of ground in a short amount of time through first-hand reporting
									and discussion. This also is a fantastic way to garner empathy with our participants by hearing the problems and issues they face on a regular basis.
									This research also helped us narrow in our scope and target user groups for the remaining research.
								</p>
								<!--Some visual here?-->
							<h3>Initial Interviews (Domain experts, end users, and community leaders)</h3>
								<p>
									We conducted primary research through extensive interviews to help us understand the problem space, critically analyze end-user needs and constraints, as
									well as understand how we might work within the processes of these organizations. We interviewed local organization leaders, academic researchers working 
									in a similar space of activist organization, as well as several end-users to understand their wants, needs, desires and constraints. I led efforts of designing the research questions and interview questions for these
									sessions. 
								</p>
							<h3>(Mini) Literature Review</h3>
							<p>A survey of academic literature across the fields of online communication, activist motivation and organization, as well as persuasive theories, helped us
								base our future research as well as our eventual design on substaintial previous evidence and work. 
							</p>
							<h3>Usability testing and iterative design</h3>
							<p>Once we understood the problem space thoroughly, we ideated through three iterations of our prototype, with each round having end-users and leaders of organizations
								provide feedback, as well as going through usability testing with common user tasks. I led the main efforts of designing tasks and user scenarios for testing, as well 
								defining usability metrics.

							<h2>Prototyped Solution</h2>
							<!--Edit text below to flow from research described-->
							<p>
								[This is work as of December 2019] The platform we designed incorporates persuasive techniques to help organizations visualize their progress. Our goal was to create an engaging virtual platform
								 that could help organizations like CMU Against ICE facilitate team collaboration and intragroup connections. <i>BetterWorld</i> is organized into five main sections: <i>World, Community, My Info, Projects, and Check Ins</i>. 
								 Together, these sections create an intuitive hierarchy and flow, one that would promote group identity while affirming and aligning individuals with the group.
							</p>

							<h3>World and Personal View</h3>
							<p>
								Users are able to visualize their group and personal contributions to the project. Current and finished projects are manifested into structures or items of the users’ choosing. With the ability to customize the items’ names and appearance, 
								these may be tangible indicators of the organization’s group identity.
							</p>
							
							<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="../portfoliopages/portfolioAssets/BetterWorldAssets/WorldToStore.gif" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h3>Community Pages</h3>
							<p>
								The Community page is a directory of all members within the organization. Members can learn about other members and the areas they are interested in. Members may also give “shout-outs” on virtual post-its that affirm and encourage others in their contributions.
							</p>
							
							<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="../portfoliopages/portfolioAssets/BetterWorldAssets//Community(DetailProfileView).png" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h3>Tasks and Projects</h3>
							<p>
								The Tasks page is designed to emphasize collaboration over individual work. This highlights group identity and uses social proof by making clear who is 
								contributing and encouraging users who have not yet contributed to participate more.
							</p>

							<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="../portfoliopages/portfolioAssets/BetterWorldAssets/TasksGif.gif" alt="" /></span> -->
							<h3>Check Ins</h3>
							<p>
								We designed both group and individual check in pages that incorporate group- and self-affirmations. These techniques have been shown to 
								help individuals with motivation and make them more equipped to deal with hardships they may face in activism work.

							<h2>Going Forward</h2>
							<p>
								We are excited to expand on this work so far with further research in the spring semester. We aim to partner with an organization to collaboratively iterate on this design, implement a MVP that can be used, 
								and test the effectiveness of the implementation and improve. This will include further refined interviews and other methods of assessing potential features and design ideas, such as <a href="https://www.innovationgames.com/buy-a-feature/" target="_blank" >"Buy-A-Feature"</a> and Card Sorting.
								Lastly, we plan on disseminating this work as a workshop or conference paper to the HCI community.
