							<h3>Summary</h3>
							<p>
								We (Team Tu) worked this past semester to deeply understand, through research, how we might assist activist organizations 
								better engage their members for more meaningful and long-term work. We designed a tool, BetterWorld, to combine the powerful 
								effects of visualizing the nebulous work that is activism with a flexible, yet structured format for task and project management 
								and visibility into institutional and group knowledge.</p>
							<p>
								We utilized a focus group approach to understand the general problem space and refine our research questions. Then we conducted an initial round of generative research 
								to learn more about X, Y, and Z, through a Literature Review and qualitative interviews with two groups of users: End-Users who are members of these activist organizations, 
								and stakeholders who are the leaders and organizers of these organizations.
							</p>
							<p>
								From here, we had a sufficent depth of understanding to begin thinking about how we might address our research questions and craft a design that would benefit the end-users.
								Through a series of brainstorming processes, rounds of feedback and critique, as well as iterative testing and re-design, we created BetterWorld.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some members of the team are taking this project and work so far and expanding on it through a case-study approach to creating an MVP and disseminating further research.
							</p>

							<h2>Problem Space And Context</h2>
							<p>
								This project was situated within the a semester long course, where we were challenged with a student-defined project to apply persuasive techniques learned in Geoff Kaufman’s 
								<a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/courses/special-topics-persuasive-design-hci" target="_blank">Persuasive Design class</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, within the <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a>. 
								Our team focused on civic engagement with the goal of maintaining and increasing engagement among members of activist organizations. I found this topic area to be highly intriguing and right in the center of my interests to use my skills 
								for projects, designs, and solutions that benefit others in the long-run. To understand and support activist work, we work towards addressing inequities systematically.
							</p>
							<p>
								Activism happens on a long-term scale, with work taking months or years to achieve desired results, and progress is often difficult to measure. In order to more effectively work towards their shared mission, 
								activists need tools that encourage sustainable, long-term engagement. They need a solution that helps effort compound over time rather than die off, as well as more visibility into institutional and group knowledge.
							</p>
						
							<span class="image main"><img src="../../images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Process</h2>

							<p>While the Persuasive Design course had a few requirements for our project, such as general structure of the research and design process, as well as some 
								intended methods, the implementation of these methods and full research and design process was up to us. Below is a short description of our 
								main phases, which provided us a strong foundation for in-depth, empathetic research, as well as iterative design.

							<h2>Process (In-depth description of my portion? Research?)</h2>
							<p>This is where the problem space is described in a bit more detail. How did we take insights and use it in the design</p>
							<p>How does this design address the problem space? How does it show an improvement of the original state into the preferred one?</p>


							<h2>Insights</h2>
							<p></p>


							<span class="image main"><img src="../../images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Prototyped Solution</h2>
							<p>
								To achieve these objectives, the platform we designed incorporates persuasive techniques to help organizations visualize their progress. Our goal was to create an engaging virtual platform
								 that could help organizations like CMU Against ICE facilitate team collaboration and intragroup connections. <i>BetterWorld</i> is organized into five main sections: <i>World, Community, My Info, Projects, and Check Ins</i>. 
								 Together, these sections create an intuitive hierarchy and flow, one that would promote group identity while affirming and aligning individuals with the group.
							</p>
							<p>
								Feel free to explore our prototype at: <a href="bit.ly/BetterWorldPrototype" target="_blank">bit.ly/BetterWorldPrototype</a>
							</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="../portfoliopages/portfolioAssets/BetterWorldAssets/SiteMap.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>World and Personal View</h3>
							<p>
								Members are able to visualize their group and personal contributions to the project. Current and finished projects are manifested into structures or items of the members’ choosing. With the ability to customize the items’ names and appearance, 
								these may be tangible indicators of the organization’s group identity.
							</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="../portfoliopages/portfolioAssets/BetterWorldAssets/WorldToStore.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Community Pages</h3>
							<p>
								The Community page is a directory of all members within the organization. Members can learn about other members and the areas they are interested in. Members may also give “shout-outs” on virtual post-its that affirm and encourage others in their contributions.
							</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="../portfoliopages/portfolioAssets/BetterWorldAssets//Community(DetailProfileView).png" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Tasks and Projects</h3>
							<p>
								The Tasks page is designed to emphasize collaboration over individual work. This highlights group identity and uses social proof by making clear who is 
								contributing and encouraging members who have not yet contributed to participate more.
							</p>

							<span class="image main"><img src="../portfoliopages/portfolioAssets/BetterWorldAssets/TasksGif.gif" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Check Ins</h3>
							<p>
								We designed both group and individual check in pages that incorporate group- and self-affirmations. These techniques have been shown to 
								help individuals with motivation and make them more equipped to deal with hardships they may face in activism work.
							</p>

							<h2>Implications and take-aways</h2>
							<p></p>

							<h2>Going Forward</h2>
							<p>
								We are excited to expand on this work so far with further research in the spring semester. We aim to partner with an organization to collaboratively iterate on this design, implement a MVP that can be used, 
								and test the effectiveness of the implementation and improve. Lastly, we plan on disseminating this work as a workshop or conference paper to the HCI community.
