								<h3>Timeline</h3>
								<p>10 weeks - October-December</p>

								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p></p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="/Phantom/images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Problem Space and Context</h2>
							<p>During the pandemic, meeting and connecting with new people over similar interests is really hard. 
								The “lobby party” vibe that KST had is lost with virtual performances. People miss being able to connect with other theatergoers 
								and virtual interactions as is do not facilitate the kind of warm community they strive for.</p>
						
							<span class="image main"><img src="/Phantom/images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Process</h2>
							<p>This is where the problem space is described in a bit more detail. What research did we do to understand the problem space? Why these research methods and questions?</p>
							<p>Participants, methods, INSIGHTS</p>
						

							<span class="image main"><img src="/Phantom/images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Evidence</h2>
							<p>“The  core of virtual interaction is the same, but not enough to make it enjoyable due to missing part of the community”*</p>
							<p>“Can't have side conversations, so everyone is a part of one big conversation which might make people feel left out”*</p>
							<p>“I appreciate [virtual] conversation time in maintaining relationships in this community.”</p>

							<h2>Insights</h2>
							<p>Virtual conversation in large groups, especially among strangers, is often intimidating for many people and discourages free flowing conversation</p>
							<p>Meeting people with similar interests broke down social barriers and was more welcoming than meeting complete strangers with no common focal point</p>
							<p>Virtual connection is more difficult and awkward than in-person connection and thus requires additional structure and aids.</p>
							<p>Despite being more socially challenging in some ways, one-on-one conversations produced much more fruitful conversation and connection than large group conversations</p>
							<p>Providing another person to rely on as a social safety net to help people feel safe in the new environment</p>
							<p>Providing participants with loose, optional conversational structure, provided by a moderator, aided in facilitating meaningful and approachable discussions</p>
							
							<span class="image main"><img src="/Phantom/images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Prototyped Solution</h2>
							<p>Taking cues from the latent need for social comfort when meeting strangers, we have developed a system for fostering community engagement through the use of focused online group meetings, wherein each participant is matched up with a “buddy” with mutual interests. </br>
								</br>
								This buddy is intended to act as a social safety net that helps users feel comfortable throughout the discussion and promotes connection. </br>
								</br>
								There will be a moderator who will explain the system, relieve ambiguity, and share the discussion points set for the meeting.
							</p>
						
								<h3>How it works</h3>
								<p>At the beginning and end of each group meeting, participants gather for informal mingling. </p>
								<p>Participants are then sent to breakout rooms with their buddy for one-on-one conversations with “conversation cards” to encourage discussion. </p>
								<p>After having some time to talk and to get to know each other, buddies are then paired up with another set of buddies for group discussion with a new set of conversation cards. </p>

								<h3>What users said</h3>

								<p>“Conversation with my buddy was warm, friendly, and refreshing. Given the pandemic and everything being remote, it was nice to connect with someone new like you would at a party... I learned something new and cool...; and formed a nice connection with my buddy.”</p>
								<p>“It was fun overall. Conversations should be fun, easy, and fluid, and that exactly what it was. It wasn't as awkward either as I thought it would be.”</p>
								<p>“This was the first time I got on a call since COVID and met someone without having too much of a purpose behind our call other than to get to know each other. I think this type of friendship building or bonding hasn't been happening for a while.”</p>
